# Pinyin Tones

This fork of the original build is for creating updated version targeting specifically Window 10

This fork also updates the description to a more Github friendly format. 

## ALPHA Software (Work in Progress)

While I am not changing anything in the C++ code for now and just repackaging the builds, am still testing this as I continue on my journey of learning Mandarin, so if you are using this fork, use at your own risk :)

Feel free to raise issues if you face them!
